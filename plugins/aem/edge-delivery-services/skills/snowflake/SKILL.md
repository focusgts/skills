description: Static-to-EDS overlay conversion that preserves the original DOM byte-for-byte while making text and image content authorable in Document Authoring. Use when converting an AI-generated static HTML page (Stardust, Mobirise, Relume, Lovable, v0, Figma-derived hand-coded, etc.) into an Edge Delivery Services page WITHOUT rewriting it into canonical block markup. Triggers on "convert this page to EDS overlay", "static-to-EDS overlay", "next experimentation", "next run", "start run #N", or when a user provides a source URL and asks to make it editable in DA while keeping the original design intact. Do NOT use for canonical EDS block-rewrite migrations — that's the page-import skill.

# Snowflake — Static-to-EDS Overlay Conversion

Convert a static HTML page into an EDS page using the **overlay
pattern**: the original DOM is preserved exactly, and only the text
and image content becomes authorable in Document Authoring. Header
and footer remain static repository fragments. The page CSS and any
animation JavaScript ship per-template under the EDS code bus.

## When to use this skill

The user has an AI-generated polished static HTML page and wants to
launch it on Edge Delivery Services without losing the original
design while still making content editable in DA.

Typical user phrasing:
- "Convert https://example.com/static-page to EDS"
- "Make this page editable in DA but keep the original markup"
- "Start the next experimentation for URL …"
- "Static-to-EDS overlay for …"

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does **not** rewrite the page into EDS-shape markup (blocks with
  `<div class="blockname">`). That's a different workflow
  (`migrate-page`). The overlay pattern is for keeping the original
  generator's DOM intact.
- Does **not** modify the EDS substrate code in the target repo
  (`scripts/scripts.js` overlay engine, lifecycle CSS, etc.) unless
  the conversion surfaces a substrate gap. Substrate evolution is a
  separate change with its own PR review.

The skill **does** support three asset strategies (see
`methodology.md` §3): `absolute` (rewrite to source-host URLs),
`vendor` (copy into `./assets/`), and `da-media` (upload to
`/media/<scope>/` via the bundled `da-media-upload.mjs` script).

## Skill dependencies

Snowflake cites DA HTML rules and the DA admin API contract from the
`da-content` skill. **Load `da-content` alongside Snowflake.**
Phases 3 (Generate) and 5 (Round-trip) reference it directly;
methodology and learnings link into specific sections by name.

## Prerequisites

Before invoking, confirm with the user:

1. **Source URL** — the static page to convert. Must be reachable
   from this machine (publicly hosted or local dev server).
2. **Target EDS repo** — owner/repo on GitHub. Must already have the
   overlay engine wired (see `knowledge/architecture.md` §"Solution
   shape"). For first-time setup, the substrate has to be in place;
   the skill assumes it.
3. **DA root path** — where in the DA tree the converted doc lands
   (e.g., `/<some-root>/<page-slug>`).
4. **DA admin token** — Snowflake consumes `$DA_TOKEN` from the
   environment, or reads `~/.aem/da-token.json` (same cache that the
   **da-auth** skill writes). If neither is set, fail early and
   invoke the **da-auth** skill to obtain one.

## How to invoke (host adapters)

**Slicc**: the cone receives a sprinkle event or chat trigger,
verifies prerequisites, then executes the phases sequentially as
described below. See `HOST-NOTES.md` for sprinkle wiring.

**Claude Code**: user types `/snowflake` or the agent
auto-invokes on description match. Either way, the agent walks
the phases sequentially.

**Generic shell / other hosts**: the assistant works through the
phases the same way — each phase is a discrete chunk of bash + Node
invocations described in the corresponding `phases/<N>-<phase>.md`
file.

Across hosts, the skill body and phase prompts never reference
host-specific primitives. The skill is sequential — no parallel
execution in this version.

```

### Resolving paths inside this bundle

When a phase prompt references `<SKILL_DIR>/knowledge/methodology.md`
or similar, the assistant resolves `<SKILL_DIR>` to the absolute path
of the directory containing this `SKILL.md` file, then substitutes
that absolute path into the bash invocation. Per host:

- **Claude Code (plugin)**: the agent reads `SKILL.md` from the plugin
  cache (e.g. `~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../skills/snowflake/`) and
  substitutes that path. Bash CWD is the target EDS repo, not the
  skill directory — never use bare `./scripts/foo.mjs`.
- **`gh upskill` / `npx skills`**: skills are installed to
  `.claude/skills/snowflake/` at the target repo root; `<SKILL_DIR>`
  resolves there.
- **Slicc**: `<SKILL_DIR>` = `/workspace/skills/snowflake/`.
- **Generic**: assistant computes the directory of `SKILL.md` and
  uses that absolute path.

Node scripts inside `scripts/` self-locate via `import.meta.url` and
work regardless of CWD once invoked with the correct absolute path.

## The `.snowflake/` directory convention

The skill writes all per-repo state, project artifacts, and project-
specific knowledge under a hidden `.snowflake/` directory at the
target repo's root:

```
.snowflake/
├── config.json                ← repo-level config (substrate version,
│                                DA root default, branch prefix, etc.)
├── knowledge/                 ← OPTIONAL — project-specific overrides
│   ├── methodology.md         ← layered on top of bundled methodology
│   ├── learnings.md           ← repo-local findings (not yet promoted)
│   └── architecture.md        ← repo-specific substrate notes
├── projects/
│   └── <NNN>-<slug>/          ← per-run folder
│       ├── state.json
│       ├── notes.md
│       ├── learnings.md
│       ├── input/
│       ├── output/
│       └── diff/
└── .backup/<timestamp>/       ← originals from substrate install
```

**Knowledge resolution order** at any phase (most-specific first):
1. `.snowflake/knowledge/<file>.md` (project-specific)
2. `<SKILL_DIR>/knowledge/<file>.md` (bundled, canonical)

This lets a repo carry findings that aren't yet generic enough to
PR upstream. Whether those eventually get promoted to the skill is
the user's call.

**Config-driven paths.** A repo can override defaults via
`.snowflake/config.json`:

```json
{
  "projectsDir": ".snowflake/projects",
  "daRoot": "/marketing",
  "branchPrefix": "snowflake-",
  "trunkBranch": "main",
  "tagPrefix": "snowflake-"
}
```

Phases fall back to the defaults shown above when the config or any
field is absent. **Recommended:** keep `branchPrefix` ending in `-`
(hyphen, not `/` slash). With a hyphen the branch name is identical
to the aem.page hostname segment and admin.hlx.page URL segment —
no translation needed. Slash-style prefixes work but require
flattening `/` → `-` when constructing aem.page hostnames (AEM
Code Sync does this automatically for hostnames but admin.hlx.page
URLs need the literal branch).

## The seven phases (sequential)

Each phase is described in its own file under `phases/`. The
assistant reads the phase prompt, executes its steps, writes any
state transitions, and proceeds to the next phase.

**Phase 0** (Prerequisites) runs once per repo. It installs the
overlay substrate if `.snowflake/config.json` is absent or its
`substrateVersion` is stale. On subsequent invocations the phase
sees the config and skips silently.

State for a single run lives in:
```
<projectsDir>/<NNN>-<slug>/state.json
```
relative to the target repo's root (found via
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`). `<projectsDir>` is
`.snowflake/projects` by default or the override from
`.snowflake/config.json`. The skill creates this on Capture and
updates it at each phase boundary. Phases check state.json on start
and skip work that's already done — reruns are safe.

### Phase summaries (full instructions in `phases/`)

0. **Prerequisites** — confirm (or install) the overlay substrate;
   write `.snowflake/config.json` with the installed version. Runs
   once per repo. See `phases/0-prereq.md`.

1. **Capture** — fetch source HTML and referenced external assets;
   set up the project folder under
   `<projectsDir>/<NNN>-<slug>/`. See `phases/1-capture.md`.

2. **Analyze** — structural map of the page; identify header/footer
   boundaries, section list, slot opportunities, head-level links to
   lift, asset rewriting strategy. Produce `notes.md` and
   `decisions.json` in the project folder. See `phases/2-analyze.md`.

3. **Generate** — produce the 5 deployable artifacts (template HTML,
   header fragment, footer fragment, page CSS, page animations JS)
   plus the DA-source body fragment. Outputs go to
   `<projectsDir>/<NNN>-<slug>/output/`. See `phases/3-generate.md`.

4. **Wire** — copy artifacts to the EDS-served paths (`templates/`,
   `fragments/<tpl>/`, `styles/`, `scripts/`), build the local-test
   drafts file, run lint. See `phases/4-wire.md`.

5. **Round-trip** — local first (dev server + headless browser
   verification), then production (branch + push + DA PUT + preview
   API + verify on `<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page`). See
   `phases/5-roundtrip.md`.

6. **Reflect** — append run findings to project notes; promote
   cross-project learnings to `knowledge/learnings.md` (a PR to the
   skill repo, if the host supports raising one); update methodology
   if any new rule emerged. **Do not close the iteration — that's a
   user decision.** See `phases/6-reflect.md`.

## Closing an iteration

The skill **never closes a run on its own**. After phase 6, it
returns control to the user and waits for an explicit close request.
Closure means tagging `iter-NNN-close` on the run branch and fast-
forwarding the integration trunk. Closure is described in
`phases/6-reflect.md` but only runs when the user asks.

## Host-portable constraints (for skill maintainers)

Maintainers extending this skill should keep it host-agnostic. See
`HOST-NOTES.md` for the full list. Key points:

- Use only: `bash`, `node` (≥22), `git`, `curl`, `jq`, `npm`/`npx`,
  `playwright-cli`, POSIX `sed`/`grep`/`awk`.
- Banned: Slicc-specific (`sprinkle send`, `upskill`), Claude-Code-
  specific (`mcp__*`, named subagents in Agent tool), any GUI / MCP
  / daemon.
- Browser interaction: **`playwright-cli` only**. No host-bundled
  browser tools.
- State files: project-relative paths (under `.snowflake/projects/`
  by default, or `${PROJECTS_DIR}` from config), never `<SKILL_DIR>`
  or `/workspace`.
- Subagent fan-out: out of scope in this version. The skill is fully
  sequential.
- Idempotency: every phase checks state.json on start. Reruns are
  safe.

## Loading knowledge in each phase

Whenever a phase prompt says "read `<SKILL_DIR>/knowledge/<file>.md`",
the assistant follows this resolution order (most-specific first):

1. **Project-specific override:** if
   `.snowflake/knowledge/<file>.md` exists in the target repo, read
   it. This is the project's layered context.
2. **Bundled, canonical:** read
   `<SKILL_DIR>/knowledge/<file>.md`. Always present in the bundle.

When the two contain overlapping rules, **the project override
wins** for that project. Treat the override as additions and
corrections, not a replacement of the bundled file.

Every phase prompt assumes this procedure; phases don't re-state it.

## Reading order for first invocation

1. This file (you're reading it).
2. Confirm the `da-content` skill is available (see "Skill
   dependencies" above). You don't need to read it linearly — phase
   prompts cite specific sections — but it must be loadable.
3. `knowledge/methodology.md` (canonical phase rules — every phase
   needs this), with the override resolution above.
4. `knowledge/architecture.md` (overlay engine and slot writer
   semantics — Generate phase needs this most).
5. `knowledge/learnings.md` (cross-project findings — Generate and
   Round-trip should at least skim this; specific entries are
   referenced by individual phase prompts).
6. The phase prompt for the current phase.

Then start at Phase 0.
